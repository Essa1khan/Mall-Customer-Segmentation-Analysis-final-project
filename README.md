An unsupervised machine learning project to segment mall customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project uses clustering algorithms to identify customer segments based on:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

**Key Achievement:** Successfully identified 5 distinct customer segments with actionable marketing strategies.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
- **Size:** 200 customers
- **Features:** 5 (CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score)
- **Type:** Numerical + Categorical

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

**Core Libraries:**
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy - Data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn - Visualization
- scikit-learn - Machine learning

**Algorithms Implemented:**
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN (Density-based clustering)
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate analysis (Age, Income, Spending distributions)
- Bivariate analysis (Income vs Spending patterns)
- Correlation analysis
- Gender-based segmentation

### 2. K-Means Clustering
- **Elbow Method:** Optimal K = 5
- **Silhouette Analysis:** Best score = {score}
- **Clusters Identified:** 5 distinct segments
- **Validation:** Multiple metrics used

### 3. DBSCAN Clustering
- **Parameters:** eps=0.7, min_samples=5
- **Outlier Detection:** {n_noise} outliers identified
- **Comparison:** Validated K-Means results

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Reduced 3D data to 2D
- Variance Explained: {variance}%
- Enhanced visualization

## 📈 Results

### Customer Segments Identified:

| Cluster | Name | Size | Avg Income | Avg Spending | Strategy |
|---------|------|------|------------|--------------|----------|
| 0 | Budget Conscious | XX | $XXk | XX/100 | Value & Discounts |
| 1 | Young Spenders | XX | $XXk | XX/100 | Trendy Products |
| 2 | High Rollers | XX | $XXk | XX/100 | Premium Services |
| 3 | Potential Targets | XX | $XXk | XX/100 | Quality Products |
| 4 | Standard Customers | XX | $XXk | XX/100 | Balanced Approach |

### Key Findings:
✅ Clear segmentation patterns identified  
✅ Income vs Spending shows 5 distinct groups  
✅ DBSCAN detected {n_noise} outlier customers  
✅ PCA successfully visualized multi-dimensional data  
✅ Actionable marketing strategies developed
